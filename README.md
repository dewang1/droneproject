# AT&T Mentorship: Autonomous Camera-Controlled Drone

## Overview
This project explores an alternative method for precise drone control by integrating computer vision, control theory, and signal processing. The system utilizes a ground-based camera to provide real-time positioning data, improving accuracy and responsiveness compared to GPS. The goal was to enable the drone to hold a precise location for applications such as measuring cell tower signals.

## Features
### Hardware
- **Modified Drone Controller**: Custom circuitry to interface with a microcontroller.
- **Microcontroller Integration**: Receives commands from a computer and outputs voltages to the drone controller.
- **Oscilloscope & Soldering Kit**: Used for circuit analysis and modification.

### Software
- **Arduino Code**: Controls communication between the microcontroller and drone.
- **Python Program**: Processes camera input, computes control signals, and sends voltage commands using:
  - **Computer Vision**: Detects and tracks drone position.
  - **PID Control Algorithm**: Ensures precise positioning adjustments.


## Project Motivation
This project was inspired by our mentor based on his work at **AT&T**, where drones measure cell tower signals. Traditional drones use GPS for positioning, but we aimed to develop a faster, more precise method by utilizing a **ground-based camera** for real-time adjustments.

## Setup
1. Modify the drone controller and wire it to the microcontroller.
2. Add colored markers to drone.
3. Set up the camera to track the droneâ€™s position.
4. Connect the microcontroller to the computer.
5. Run the main Python program.

## Usage
1. Power on the drone and fly it above the camera.
4. Adjust PID parameters for fine-tuned stability.
